To deploy your EAR application on an Open Liberty server, run the Maven liberty:run goal from the finish directory
using the -pl flag to specify the ear project. The -pl flag specifies the project where the Maven goal runs.

    mvn -pl ear liberty:run

    http://localhost:9080/converter/

I have also created a runner RunLibertyDev that runs the server in development mode and deploys the ear.
